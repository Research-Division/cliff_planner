The dashed gray line in the chart below shows the Minimum Household Budget—the bare minimum cost of household basics necessary to live and work in the modern economy. When family take-home pay reaches the amount indicated by the dashed gray line, the family can afford the Minimum Household Budget.

The two income lines on the chart differ from the same lines in the chart above in two ways: 1) the chart below includes an individual’s income plus any income earned by family members and 2) the chart below shows income minus taxes ('take-home pay').

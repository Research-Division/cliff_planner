The Minimum Household Budget is the bare minimum cost of household basics necessary to live and work in the modern economy. These basic budget items include housing, child care, food, transportation, health care, and technology (a smartphone plan), plus taxes and a contingency (miscellaneous) fund equal to 10% of the household budget. The budget is calculated separately for each county and for different household types.<br>
<br>
The Minimum Household Budget largely reflects the work of <strong><u><a href="22ALICE_Methodology.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">United for ALICE</a></u></strong>. ALICE® stands for Asset Limited, Income Constrained, Employed and includes households that earn more than the Federal Poverty Level yet struggle to afford basic expenses.  
<br><br>
In specific instances, the CLIFF suite of tools may incorporate different values for food, housing, and health care costs than those provided by United For ALICE. For example, ALICE assumes that a household participates in an employer-sponsored health insurance plan when available. In contrast, CLIFF tools determine and assign the most cost-effective bundle for a household’s health care needs. This could include a scenario in which an adult participates in an employer insurance plan while children in the household receive Medicaid. Additionally, there are scenarios in which the CLIFF suite of tools may incorporate slightly different food costs than the calculations produced by United For ALICE. Specifically, the value of any benefit in the CLIFF suite of tools, including those associated with food expenditures, cannot exceed the cost of the associated expense.

CLIFF wage projections are based on a variety of assumptions and are only meant to provide a benchmark for CLIFF tools users. A brief overview of the procedure is provided below, followed by more technical details for the interested user on the <strong><u><a href="https://www.atlantafed.org/economic-mobility-and-resilience/advancing-careers-for-low-income-families/cliff-tool" target="_blank" >Advancing Careers Webpage.</a></u></strong>.

Wage projections are generated in two steps. First, an entry-level wage is determined based on granular occupation and location-specific wage percentiles from the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics (OEWS).  In particular, we assume that wages start somewhere between the 10th and 25th percentiles of the local or state-specific occupational wage distribution. Second, wages are assumed to grow with experience from this starting level by applying returns to experience that are estimated using household survey data from the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey (ACS) and standard parametric methods from the labor economics literature. The returns to experience are typically allowed to vary by occupation and by state, except when there is insufficient data to allow for this flexibility (in which case returns to experience only vary by occupation). Annual earnings are obtained by assuming a full-time full-year schedule (40 hours per week for 52 weeks per year).
If there is a training period associated with the chosen occupation, predicted earnings are delayed until the training has been completed and workers are assumed to work part-time in a near-minimum wage job during the training period (a cashier job in the chosen location assuming 20 hours per week for 52 weeks per year). Predicted wage profiles are also shifted upwards to comply with prevailing state minimum wages (both active minimum wages and future increases that states have announced).

<br>
Projections for a near-minimum wage job are obtained using the wage growth associated with a cashier worker in the chosen county.

The calculations for public assistance programs, taxes, and tax credits are produced using the <strong><u><a href="https://www.atlantafed.org/economic-mobility-and-resilience/advancing-careers-for-low-income-families/policy-rules-database.aspx" target="_blank" >Policy Rules Database.</a></u></strong>

To estimate taxpayer savings we assume that a person who transitions off of a public assistance program with a wait list is not replaced by another person.

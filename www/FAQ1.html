<strong>What are each of the public assistance programs shown in CLIFF?</strong>
</h4>
  </div>
  A brief summary of each program is provided in the 'Programs and Tax Credits' section below. To visually see how any of these programs vary by state, income level, and family composition view the <strong><u><a href="https://emar-data-tools.shinyapps.io/prd_dashboard/" target="_blank" >Policy Rules Database Dashboard.</a></u></strong>
<br>
<br>
<div>
  <h4> 
  <strong>Are the rules for each program in this tool up-to-date?</strong>
  </h4>
    </div>
    Benefit amounts, eligibility thresholds, and other important factors are often adjusted in many of the programs modeled in this tool. See the 'Rule Years in PRD' tab in our <strong><u><a href="https://emar-data-tools.shinyapps.io/prd_dashboard/" target="_blank" >PRD Dashboard</a></u></strong> tool to see the how current our data is for each program in each state.

<div><h4><strong>How do I save my results? </strong></h4></div>
For privacy reasons, information is never stored in CLIFF tools. To save your results, click CTRL+P (COMMAND+P on Mac) and save the printed page as a PDF.<br><br>
<div>
<h4> 
<strong>Who should I include in my 'family'?</strong>
</h4>
</div>
Include anyone in your household with whom you share financial resources and/or include on a single tax return--the filer, the filer's spouse, and any dependents. The CLIFF tools assume all family members are part of the household and file a single, joint tax return for the purposes of benefits calculations.
<br>
<br>
<div>
<h4> 
<strong>How do we project wages in the calculations shown in the results tab?</strong>
</h4>
  </div>
See methodology below.
<br>
<br>
<div>
<h4> 
<strong>Where can I find information on the training required for different careers?</strong>
</h4>
  </div>
We recommend that you utilize information about typical skills and education required for any job available on <strong><u><a href="https://www.mynextmove.org/" target="_blank" >mynextmove.org.</a></u></strong>
<br>
<br>
In addition, talk to local employers and career counselors operating in your areas to learn if local job requirements differ from the typical national requirements shown on 'My Next Move'. 
<br>
<br>
<div>
<h4> 
<strong>I'm not currently receiving any public assistance. Should I include it in my analysis?</strong>
</h4>
  </div>
No. CLIFF dashboard includes government assistance program values using the assumption that the person is already receiving the selected program(s). For some programs, eligibility rules differ for those currently enrolled and new enrollees. To assess potential eligibility for programs see the CLIFF Snapshot Tool. To see how eligibility rules differ between those currently enrolled and new enrollees see the PRD dashboard.
<br>
<br>
<div><h4><strong>What public assistance programs might I qualify for? </strong></h4></div>
The CLIFF suite of tools are not intended to determine eligibility for assistance programs. This is especially true for SSI and SSDI, which have very complex qualification considerations. At the same time, selecting public assistance programs within the CLIFF suite of tools can provide users with the potential estimated value of programs for which they may be qualified. It is important to note, however, that programs can take time to obtain due to the process of completing paperwork, documentation of eligibility, and in some cases extended waitlists. For example, child care assistance waitlists and housing voucher waitlists can sometimes be years-long. 
<br>
<br>
<div><h4><strong>Does my state offer universal free school meals for children?</strong></h4></div>
The following states have made recent legislative or administrative changes that provide universal free school meals to school-age children: CA, CO, GA, IL, ME, MA, MI, MN, NV, VT. The benefit must be selected in order to be reflected in the charts and calculations.
<br>
<div>
<h4> 
<strong>I'm receiving a program that is not on the list. What should I do?</strong>
</h4>
  </div>
  See full list in 'Programs not included in CLIFF' below. If a program you are receiving is not on the list of programs in CLIFF, you should check with your case manager to learn about the eligibility rules and do your own calculations to learn how it will impact your budget. 
<br>
<br>
<div><h4><strong>How is out-of-pocket health insurance cost determined? </strong></h4></div>
For purposes of calculating net financial resources, CLIFF automatically calculates the out-of-pocket cost of health insurance based on the lowest cost option for which the household is eligible. To determine the potential set of health insurance options, CLIFF takes into consideration the programs you select from the list and the cost of purchasing health insurance through an employer. The cost of health insurance (both the total cost and the unsubsidized out-of-pocket cost) varies by source. For example, the premium paid each month will depend on whether the person is receiving Employer Sponsored Health Insurance, Medicaid/CHIP, or health insurance through the Health Exchange Marketplace. Medicare is not included in the health insurance calculations.

<h4> 
<strong>What is a Benefits Cliff and a Benefits Plateau?</strong>
</h4>
  </div>
  Benefit Cliffs and Plateaus occur when employment income increases but due to losses in public assistance the household is not financially better off. Wage increases can impact eligibility for public assistance programs. Due to the loss of these programs, career advancement opportunities can result in the family being financially worse off (a benefits cliff) or no better off (a benefits plateau) than before the wage increase. You can tell if the person experiences a benefit cliff or plateau by examining the net resources chart. If the person's income increases from one year to the next but net resources decline, the person may face a benefits cliff. If the person's income increases from one year to the next but net resources are unchanged, the person may face a benefit plateau. Learn more about benefits cliffs on our <strong><u><a href="https://www.atlantafed.org/economic-mobility-and-resilience/advancing-careers-for-low-income-families/what-are-benefits-cliffs.aspx" target="_blank" >website.</a></u></strong>

<h4>
<strong>I tried selecting an occupation for my selected county, but I don't see it. Where is it?</strong>
</h4>
</div>
If an occupation is not on the dropdown menu, it means their is not enough people with that job in that county for the Bureau of Labor Statistics to generate wage estimates. 
<br>
<br>
<div>
<h4>
<strong>What types of income are assumed to be $0?</strong>
</h4>
</div>
The following types of income affect eligibility for some programs and are assumed to be $0 for the purposes of generating calculations in CLIFF Dashboard: child support, investment income, gifts, unemployment insurance, pensions, and state disability payments.

<br>
<br>
<div>
<h4>
<strong>How do the results differ for persons with disabilities?</strong>
</h4>
</div>
This tool incorporates special rules for individuals with disabilities for the following programs: SSDI, SSI, Medicaid, SNAP, Section 8 Housing Choice Vouchers, and Federal Income Taxes. In some states, children with disabilities may be subject to different rules for the CCDF program; these state-specific rules are not incorporated. The following programs count SSI and SSDI income towards eligibility: SNAP, WIC, School Meals, Head Start/Early Head Start, and Section 8 Housing Choice Vouchers. 

<br>
<br>
<div>
<h4>
<strong>Are eligibility redetermination periods factored in these calculations?</strong>
</h4>
</div>
Some programs have probational periods where participants are able to keep a benefit for some period after they are no longer eligible - for example, if their income passes a threshold. Probational periods vary by state and program and are not factored in the tools.
<br>
<br>
<div>
<h4> 
<strong>Do wages and and expenses account for inflation?</strong>
</h4>
  </div>
  All projections are in today's dollars. In the long run, the change in real wages (adjusted for inflation) have averaged about 0% over the past 40 years. This means that, on average, wages and inflation grow at the same rate. See data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis' <strong><u><a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/fredgraph.png?g=QCgj" target="_blank" >FRED</a></u></strong>
<br>
<br>
<div><h4><strong>Are the effects of income changes on wage garnishments or child support payments factored in? </strong></h4></div>
No. The effects of income changes on wage garnishments, child support payments, etc. are not included in these calculations.<br><br>
